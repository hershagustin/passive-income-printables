			<h2>About Us</h2>	
			<div>
                <p>Hi, I’m Christine Yu, the founder of Passive Income Printables. A few years ago, I was looking for a way to earn money online. I tried a few different things, but nothing really worked until I discovered selling printables on Etsy. What started as a small side hustle quickly became something I was passionate about, and I soon realized that printables could be a great way to earn passive income. Over time, I learned the ins and outs of the business, and now I’m here to share my journey with you.</p>

                <p>I’ve always been passionate about design and even studied Graphic Design in school, so it felt natural for me to start creating digital products. My background in graphic design helped me turn this into a business. I remember when I made my first sale, which felt like a huge success. Since then, I’ve sold thousands of printables on Etsy. Today, I’m proud to say that I’m one of the top sellers in the printables category. It hasn’t always been easy, but through trial and error, I’ve learned how to make my shop successful and how to earn great reviews from customers.</p>

                <p>Positive reviews have been key to growing my shop. I learned that when I deliver a product that’s high-quality, easy to use, and fits the customer’s needs, the reviews naturally follow. Responding to customer feedback, offering great customer service, and making sure the products are truly valuable are all things that helped me build a loyal customer base.</p>
